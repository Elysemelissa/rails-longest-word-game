<h1>Longest Word Game</h1>
<p>The Longest Word Game is a simple letter game, built as an exercise for Le Wagon to practice Ruby on Rails.</p> 

<h3>How it works</h3>
<li>You are given a random set of nine letters and you have to enter the longest English word you can find with these letters.</li>
<li>The game checks if all of the letters in the word you have submitted are present in the given letter set.</li>
<li>If yes, the game uses the Le Wagon Dictionary API to check if your word is a valid English word.</li>
<li>If valid, the game calculates the score based on the length of the word.</li>
<li>The score is saved in the browser session.</li>
